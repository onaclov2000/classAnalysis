Using Set operations on class listings to determine what classes to take

Run with nodejs for now, maybe eventually this will be a browser class (nothing I am using is a nodejs only implementation like the requires and stuff, however I just haven't built an index.html and called it up... anywho, you may want to fiddle to find out about the classes you want.
